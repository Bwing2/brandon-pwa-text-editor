## Description

As a developer, it is important to be able to know and understand all different kinds of web applications. The project for this week was to create a text editor that functionally can be used without any internet. Included are also ways to preserve data such as service workers, manifest file, and pre caching static assets in case a browser or feature isn't avaliable. This application uses both client and server folders. The client folder and frontend are built using webpack, and everything can be run with npm commands.
